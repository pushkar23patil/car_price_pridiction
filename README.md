# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Project 📈

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project repository! In this project, I aim to predict car prices using various machine learning algorithms and techniques. I have gone through a rigorous process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to arrive at my best-performing model, the Random Forest Regressor.

## Project Overview 🌟

In this project, I've accomplished the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: I started by cleaning and preparing the dataset to remove any inconsistencies and missing values.

2. **EDA**: Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted, including univariate, bivariate, statistical testing, and multivariate analysis to gain insights into the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: I employed feature engineering techniques to create new features and enhance the predictive power of my models.

4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Dimensionality reduction through PCA was explored to reduce complexity and improve model performance.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features was carried out to prepare the data for modeling.

6. **Model Development**: I developed several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest Regressor.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Thorough model evaluation was performed, and various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared were used to compare and select the best-performing model.

## Best Model 🏆

After evaluating all the models, the **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the top performer, demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities.
